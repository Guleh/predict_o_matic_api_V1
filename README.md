# PredictOMatic

This is the first version of the predict_o_matic API. The current version is private.<br>
Predict-o-matic is a project which tries to generate predictions for the crypto currency market.
These predictions are made using self-optimizing machine learning algorithms.<br>
This API is created using Django. <br> Machine learning, data analysis and sentiment analysis is done using Pandas, 
Numpy, SKLearn, Keras and Flair. <br>
Tasks are automated by celery and handled by redis. <br>
The entire project is deployed using docker and docker compose on AWS.

*Do not use this program as there are still some bugs present, which were fixed in V2.*
*Any key or address that had been used in this program and is still present in the code is no longer valid.*

This project is made for fun and is in no way intended to provide actual trading advice.
