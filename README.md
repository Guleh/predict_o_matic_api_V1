# PredictOMatic

This is the first version of the predict_o_matic API. The current version is private.<br>
Predict-o-matic is a project which tries to generate predictions for the crypto currency market. These predictions are made using self-optimizing machine learning algorithms.

This API is created using Django. Machine learning, data analysis and sentiment analysis is done using Pandas, 
Numpy, SKLearn, Keras and Flair. 

Tasks are automated by celery and handled by redis. 

The entire project is deployed using docker and docker compose on AWS.

This project is made for fun and is in no way intended to provide actual trading advice.
